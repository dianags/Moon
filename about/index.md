My current research interests are in **knowledge acquisition** for **machine reading comprehension** and **question answering**, particulary when **common sense knowledge** is required. I am also interested in temporal reasoning, especially on it's application to the clinical domain. Other interests include sports and music. 

Previously, I worked as data manager of a clinical trial at the <a href="https://mentalhealth.apec.org/partners/mexico/mexico-ram%C3%B3n-de-la-fuente-mu%C3%B1iz-national-institute-psychiatry" target="_blank"><b>National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Mu√±iz</b></a> in Mexico City. Before that, I graduated in Computer Science with a major in Networking and Security from <a href="https://tec.mx/en/ciudad-de-mexico" target="_blank"><b>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</b></a> in 2010.
